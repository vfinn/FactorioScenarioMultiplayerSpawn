[MOD Portal Link](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/oarc-mod)

## NO LONGER BEING MAINTAINED
The mod should mostly be stable now for use in Factorio V2.0 and space age now.
Read the info on the mod page to understand the unresolved/unsolvable issues.

## Versions
###### Mod Only Versions: 
Check releases for stable versions. Or just go to the actual mod page like a normal person: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/oarc-mod  
2.1.X supports Factorio V2.0 with and without the Space Age expansion.  
2.0.X supports Factorio V1.1.110 and has a nicer GUI but fewer features than the older scenario version.

###### Scenario Versions: 
1.1.X is the latest stable version for Factorio V1 that I plan to do minimal maintenance on.  
0.17 and 0.16 have final stable versions that will no longer be maintained.  

## Status
Latest 2.1.X version is stable and playable on Factorio V2.0.X with and without Space Age.
Please read the info on the mod page to understand the unresolved/unsolvable issues!
